TODO

- When list table is too long footer move over it.
- Show/hide search form link's style is wrong
- Use Yii::app()->createAbsoluteUrl everywhere
- quote/edit. approved time.
- quotes/edit. all tags in one line
- Remove index.php URI segment.

FRONTEND
- Tags cloud
- Pages:
	* All quotes list. Sort order -- newest the first.
	* All quotes for some tag. Sort order -- newest the first.
	* Search. Search by author, text.
	* About page.
	* Add quote.
	* RSS (DONE)
	
SOME IDEAS FOR FUTURE
- Make authors table, in this case we can sort quotes by authors.
- Cache tags, for example.
- Database keys.
